Former Google Developer Student Club Lead and founder of theDevArmy, focused on building a strong hackathon culture within India, through our initiative called [theHackCalendar](https://theDevarmmy.com/theHackCalendar) where we are trying to list all the Indian in-person hackathons at one place.

I am interested in contributing to the Google Seasons of Docs and looking for Developer Advocate Opportunities.

Under theDevArmy we have built a WhatsApp Community of 1500+ hackathon enthusiasts, 500+ on Discord, and 450+ subscribers on theHackCalendar.
